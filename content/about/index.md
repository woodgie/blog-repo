## Hi there, I'm William. Nice to meet you.

{{< figure src="/media/images/bourne_woods.jpeg" alt="They just finished filming the second series of 'The Witcher' there." position="centre" style="border-radius: 12px;" caption="Me with my back to where the opening battle in 'Gladiator' was filmed. They chased the Barbarians into the treeline in the background." captionPosition="right" captionStyle="color: green;" >}}

I'm a Mac geek, currently running the macOS estate in an enterprise organisation but for the past 25 years I've done macOS stuff at pretty much every level, from small MSPs up to where I am now.

I've used Apple computers since the [Apple //e], finally being able to buy a [Performa 400] for myself in 1992. It has been Macs all the way since then to today, when I find myself writing this on an [M1 Mac Mini].

Why am I writing this blog? Well, I'm constantly learning things. So many things! A lot of which I stumble across in the course of my day job but a great deal I learn from colleagues and friends in talking about IT in general. My aim with this blog is to note some of it down, not least because it'll give *me* somewhere to look back and remember how I did something useful. I do hope though, that in the course of all this *you* learn something too and can carry that through to what you do.

As such, I'm licensing the blog posts (and the blog posts *only*) under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License]. Please do note the Non Commercial aspect of this. I don't mind if you're another Mac/IT/SysAdmin type, even if you make beer money from advertising on your site. But if you're a company and you want to put anything I've written on your Company site then please eMail me regarding licensing.

In short this means you are free to:
* __Share___ — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
* __Adapt__ — remix, transform, and build upon the material
