So like a lot of geeks, at home I run my own DNS ([bind] & [PiHole]) as well as using 'professional' networking kit ([UniFi]) as well as having a couple of Mac Minis running as [ESXi] servers (I'm too cheap to pay for it, so no [vSphere] for me just plain old ESXi 7) as well as having...

Well OK, maybe I *do* go a little over the top...

Not that I need any of that, I freely admit. The complexity does however keep me on my toes and require me to 'engage brain' before doing anything that might bugger things up for other users. Yes, I'm talking about my wife, she *will* let me know when things are not working. Being aware of what will change and how that will affect other users is a good thing and great practice for my day job where decisions made about what to do on the macOS estate will not affect just one other user but more than two thousand other users. So I'd better make the right decision.

And what do we need to make good decisions? Information about wheat we're trying to decide on, of course!
