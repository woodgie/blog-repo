### Well hello there.

What's going on here? Well I'm trying my hand at blogging, again...

This time I'm using [GoHugo] as the framework with the [Mainroad] theme, hosted on [GitHub Pages]. There's some funky GitHub automation stuff going on in the background which (I'll be honest) I don't *entirely* understand yet, having been very kindly given a 101 on what to do by my friend and erstwhile colleague, [Piero Mamberti]. I'm sure I'll get around to writing it up at some point. Probably.

Given how new I am to [GoHugo], [Go] (the language in which it is written) and most importantly [YAML] & [TOML] (the two configuration languages used by GoHugo) as well as the fact that I'm relatively new to [GitHub] and all that entails, please expect there to be quite a few problems to start with. Especially with navigating the website not quite working the way you might expect.

The other new thing to me here, is [Markdown]. A text based method of indicating to an application (in this instance, your web browser via the Hugo web server) how to render text by using certain 'control characters' to denote various text styles. For instance surrounding a word with asterisks renders it as italic, hence \*italic\* becomes *italic*, see? Its sort of like HTML but exponentially simpler. I am certain that many of the initial teething problems I have will be formatting ones because of my lack of understanding quite how Markdown works.

Right, let's publish this and see how that works!
